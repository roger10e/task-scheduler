### Roger Tenny's Portfolio doesn't have much yet, but here's to hoping that changes!

## Functionality

Users can enter text into any of the 9 hourlong time-blocks on the application, to show their to-do tasks or to plan their daily work schedule.
These time-blocks appear gray when the time is in the past, green when they're in the future, and red when it is in the same hour.
After inputting their text, users can click a save button to save the data to the local storage, which will persist after the page has been refreshed.

That's about it.
